This plugin calculates the result (FV) of making periodic deposits or investments. Create a schedule and charts. Supports international conventions.

== Description ==

[FC's Savings Calculator Plugin](https://financial-calculators.com/calculator-plugins/savings-calculator-plugin) answers the question "How much will I have after I make a series of deposits assuming a fixed rate of interest?". It creates a detail saving schedule with date based deposits as well as a set of charts. A site's users can select their own currency and date convention used in the future value schedule. This is ideal if your attracts visitors from around the globe. Select from one of four predefined sizes or modify the CSS file to customize size and change colors. Supports touch devices and a responsive designed website. This plugin is based on and uses the code from my [Savings Calculator](https://financial-calculator.com/savings-calculator).

*Rebranding with your site's brand name is supported and encouraged.*

The plugin may be used (a) in a post or page's content area via a *shortcode*; or (b) used in a *sidebar widget area*; or (c) called from any template file. See __usage__ under installation for details.

**Installation**

Either (a) upload the *fc-savings-calculator* folder with all its files to the */wp-content/plugins/* folder or (b) unzip the plugin's zip file in the */wp-content/plugins/* folder.

Activate the plugin through the *Plugins -> Installed Plugins* menu in WordPress


*Usage*

There are 3 mutually exclusive ways you can deploy the calculator to an individual page (though you can use all three methods on different pages within a site):

1. If you are using widgets, just add the plugin to the sidebar through the Appearance -> Widgets menu in WordPress. Be sure to click *Save*.
1. Add the following code *&lt;?php show_fcsavings_plugin(); ?&gt;* to your template where you want the calculator to appear. See below for options.
1. Add the shortcode *[fcsavingsplugin]* in the content area of your page or post and configure shortcode parameters.

__Shortcode parameters__

	* sc_size= tiny | small | medium | large
	* sc_custom_style= No | Yes
	* sc_add_link= No | Yes
	* sc_brand_name= 
	* sc_hide_resize= No | Yes
	* sc_save_amt=
	* sc_n_months=
	* sc_rate=
	* sc_currency=
	* sc_date_mask=

Examples (1st includes all options):

`[fcsavingsplugin sc_size="medium" sc_custom_style="No" sc_add_link="No" sc_brand_name="" sc_hide_resize="No" sc_save_amt="1200.0" sc_n_months="240" sc_rate="5.5" sc_currency="83" sc_date_mask="2"]`

`[fcsavingsplugin sc_size="small" sc_custom_style="Yes" sc_hide_resize="Yes" sc_currency="83" sc_date_mask="2"]`

`[fcsavingsplugin sc_custom_style="No" sc_add_link="Yes" sc_brand_name="Friendly Financial Planners" sc_hide_resize="Yes" sc_save_amt="1050.0" sc_n_months="180" sc_rate="5.5"]`

__Optional array parameter passed to *show_fcsavings_plugin()*__

Valid values for options are the same as the shortcode above.

	<?php show_fcsavings_plugin(array('op_size' => "medium",
			'op_custom_style' => "No",
			'op_add_link' => "Yes",
			'op_brand_name' => "Karl's",
			'op_hide_resize' => "No",
			'op_save_amt' => "1000.00",
			'op_n_months' => "180",
			'op_rate' => "5.5",
			'op_currency' => "999",
			'op_date_mask' => "999"
			)); ?>

*Notes:*

1. If you want to add your brand to the calculator, the *_add_link option must be set to "Yes" (i.e. create a subtle follow link to financial-calculators.com). 
1. When branding, the brand name will be added before "Savings Calculator".
1. If _custom_style is set to "Yes", the plugin will load fin-calc-widgets-custom.css located in the plugin's CSS folder. If you set the option to "Yes" without making any changes, the calculator will change to a horrendous red which indicates the custom css is being used.
1. The plugin is built and tested on HTML5/CSS3 pages.
1. size (max-width): large: 440px, medium: 340px, small: 290px, tiny: 150px
1. The modal dialog that allows users to select a default currency and date format is NOT compatible with some other dialogs. If you have a modeal on the webpage you want to install this calculator on, either your modal or the calculator's modal may not work.
1. Website developers can set a default currency sign and preferred date format by setting <op/sc>_currency and <op/sc>_date_mask respectively. Set one or both to an integer value. For the list of integers to support 90 plus currency symbols and 6 date format options, see the file __currency_and_date_conventions.txt__ in the plugin's root folder. (example: India, Indian Rupee: â‚¹1,23,45,678.99 = 83)

*Enhanced Internationalization*

New: Support for over 90 currency signs (using appropriate nummber formatting conventions) and 6 date formats (mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, yyyy.mm.dd etc.). If neither the website developer or the user makes a selection, the calculator will read the browser's default currency and date options and automatically use them. Without doing anything, a website visitor from Japan visiting a website hosted in France will initially see a floating yen sign. The website developer can easily override this default behavior by setting either shortcodes or function options. The user (if the website designer keeps the feature enabled) can override both and select a currency and date format.

*To summarize, the plugin determines what currency symbol (and date format) to use by applying the following rules:*

1. If a website allows a user to select a symbol, and the user makes a selection, the plugin uses the visitor's choice first.
2. Otherwise, if a user has not made a selection, and the website owner has set a default currency (i.e., currency does not equal 999), the calculator uses the website's selection.
3. Otherwise, the calculator plugin will attempt to read the browser's currency default and pick a currency symbol.
4. Otherwise, the plugin defaults to using the '$' symbol.


*Roadmap:*

1. Redesign that allows multiple calculators to work on the same web page - completed v.1.2.0.
1. Allow website owner to select a default currency and date format - completed v.1.4.0
1. Give website owners the ability to not let their visitors change the default date format or currency - completed v.1.3.0

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

__Can the Savings Calculator plugin be used on a commercial website?__

Yes. I would be honored. Thanks.

Also, if you happen to be a financial blogger, I would encourage you to add a "Calculators" or "Tools" section to your site and include all my calculators. More content equals more opportunity. I expect to have seven free plugins by early 2017.

__Does your plugin have any embed advertising?__

Absolutely not.

__Is your plugin self contained?__

Yes. 100% of the plugin is installed on your server. There are no external dependencies.

__Does the plugin include any backlinks?__

No, not by default. If you decide to brand the calculator with your brand and / or set the *add_link* option to *Yes*, one discreet link is added to my site. (User will not know there is a link unless their mouse passes over it.) The link is around the copyright in the lower left. :)

__Is the calculator plugin responsive?__

Yes. In fact, I use it on a Bootstrap responsive site. 

__Does the calculator support touch devices?__

Yes. Users use the calculator with all types of devices. (A previous issue with some Android devices is fixed.)

__Do you offer other calculator plugins?__

Yes. Besides those included in the WordPress directory, I'm offering a "Plus" versions of my plugins on my website. They are free for a limited time.

__I like your plugin and I'd like to contribute something but I notice you don't have a link for contributions, why not?__

Thank you. That's very kind of you. Actually, you can contribute, and it won't cost you a cent. Please stop by my [website](https://financial-calculators.com) and check it out. In addition to providing some very advanced calculators, I think that I'm the only one that provides free support via a public forum. Take a look, and if you like what you see, please spread the word. That's better than any monetary compensation.
